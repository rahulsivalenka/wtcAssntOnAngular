# Services
#### What?
AngularJS supports the concepts of "Separation of Concerns" using services architecture. Services are javascript functions and are responsible to do specific tasks only. This makes them an individual entity which is maintainable and testable. Controllers, filters can call them on requirement basis. Services are normally injected using dependency injection mechanism of AngularJS.
